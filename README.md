# MNIST1d classifier

I'm interested in working with new libraries and continuing to expand my skillset as a machine learning developer. In past projects, I've typically done hyperparameter optimization manually, in an unstructured manner. In this repository, I look into more structured hyperparameter optimization using Ray Tune on a relatively small dataset, [MNIST1d](https://github.com/greydanus/mnist1d).

This is an experimental repository designed for personal use.
